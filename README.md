1. Two default projects are included
	1. Default Keil project, with CMSIS files v.1.3.0 included
	2. Default Keil project, with CMSIS files v.1.3.0 included and clock for STM32F429-Discovery slowed down to 168MHz for USB configuration
	3. Default Keil project, without CMSIS files included, because they are in Keil packs
	4. Default Keil project, without CMSIS files included, because they are in Keil packs and clock for STM32F429-Discovery slowed down to 168MHz for USB configuration
	5. How to make own Keil project? http://stm32f4-discovery.com/2014/04/stm32f429-discovery-with-cmsis-library-in-keil/
